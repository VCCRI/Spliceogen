We provide two versions of the Spliceogen database. Both databases have genome-wide coverage, with predictions provided for every position within every annotated multi-exon protein-coding transcript (1.29 billion base pairs in total, or 4.9 billion SNVs).

The comprehensive version contains all scores, including for silencers and enhancers: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/spliceogen/databases/hg38.zip

The “focussed” version contains all donor/acceptor predictions (no silencer/enhancer scores): https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/spliceogen/databases/hg38._focussed.zip

Due to the sheer number of scores and predictions generated, we expect that the comprehensive database may be unwieldy for many use cases. In general we recommend running the tool to obtain comprehensive predictions, which has the advantage of including predictions for indels and (optionally) branchpoints.

The focussed database is much smaller, without reducing the sensitivity of donor/acceptor predictions, since it excludes the vast majority of SNVs which fall outside of splice sites and are very unlikely to create a donor/acceptor motif (logistic regression prediction score <0.7). All SNVs within annotated splice sites and all SNVs likely to create a de novo donor or acceptor motif are represented in this database.
