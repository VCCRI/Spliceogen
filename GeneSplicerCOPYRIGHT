NOTICE:
Adapted by Steve Monger in August 2018 in order to:
1) allow processing of multiple-line FASTA input files.
2) to read strand and variant information from the input FASTA header lines.
3) to restrict motif scanning to only the given strand orientation.
4) to output variant information alongside predictions.

The original source code is included for comparison using:
>diff genesplicer.cpp genesplicerOriginal.cpp
The original executable is provided. The adapted executable has been renamed.
